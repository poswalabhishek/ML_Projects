ReadMe

For this Assignment, I provide 4 files.

1. 20557578_code.ipynb (zipped alongside with readme)
2. 20557578_p1.csv (contains predictions)
3. 20557578_report.pdf (contains all the questions along with their answers and makor findings)
4. 205557578_mytest.pdf (contains the code along with the outputs that I had when I ran the code)

Things to do before compiling and running the code:

1. "PATH" variable inside the code should be changed to whatever path all the other files can be located.

2. To load the images, please create Data directory and put Images directory inside Data. You should be able to load the images using that.

3. For question 8:

IMPORTANT: Just like "Data" directory, a "1Data" directory needs to be created so that fresh transformations could be performed. During the start of the assignment, I did not realize that the original images would be used again. As a result, I had replaced all the images as transformed images in the "Data" directory. So, it is very important that "1Data" directory is created with all the original images inside of it.


To check if the code runs, simply put it in jupyter or google colab and run it. Given that all the images and libraries used in the assignment are installed on the grader's desktop, he should be able to run it without any problem.

There are also log files that will be created as the code is run to save the checkpoints.

Finally, when running if any of the results contradict with my output, the grader can always open 20557578_mytest.pdf to check if the reported results were the same as I claim them.

If there is any kind of difficulty, please contact me at aposwal@connect.ust.hk.

Thanks for taking out time to grade this assignment.
