All the code is inside 20557578_code.ipynb file and the answers to the questions are answered inside the file itself in Markdown.
The code can be easily run, showing all the statistics, graphs as required in the file. However, before running the file, the two datasets should be manually included by the graded since I have been asked to not include them.
There are also subsequent comments for the grader to read in case something does not make sense.
Although I have tried to seperate all the parts from one another, it was easier to mix them at some points for better understanding for example grouping of libraries and preprocessing data. 
There is also a report named 20557578_report.pdf for the grader to exclusively read about the progression and find my interpretations of the questions.
Finally, there is also 20557578_html_jupyter_notebook.htm to see the graphs and stats that were present at the last time I had run the program. It should also be noted that the graphs and stats might change because of the randomness introduced by RandomSearchCV in the later parts of the code, therefore, in case the grader runs the program and loses the graphs from which I had interpreted the information, they should look at the html file. Everthing can be found in the zip file named 20557578_pdf_code.zip.


Thanks for taking time to mark my assignment.
